Tracking all the goings on in a basketball game


I have started a version 1 roboflow model that is open to the public or I can add people who are interested in this project to help speed up the process of annotating images which you can find here: https://universe.roboflow.com/basketballdribble/dribble-identifier
I had about 5,000+ more annotated photos but I didn't go through with version 2 because, well.. life. I will have to get back into the swing of annotating when I get in the mood of doing that painstaking process. Also, you can find highlights of every basketball game in snippets on https://thehighlow.io/ feel free to use the code in my framer.py to get images from the video.  
Right now I would love some kind of guidance in how to move forward in main.py the error is on line 58:  detect_params = model("/Users/jamesschwartz/PycharmProject/nbatracker/TestDetection/highlight4.mp4", 40, 30) so i will have to look further into YOLOv8 for answers on this. Maybe the way i've entered the parameters is outdated. feel free to email me your thoughts at jschwartz374@gmail.com!
